Video generation has advanced rapidly, improving evaluation methods, yet assessing video's motion remains a major challenge. Specifically, there are two key issues: 1) current motion metrics do not fully align with human perceptions; 2) the existing motion prompts are limited. Based on these findings, we introduce **VMBench**---a comprehensive **V**ideo **M**otion **Bench**mark that has perception-aligned motion metrics and features the most diverse types of motion. VMBench has several appealing properties: (1) **Perception-Driven Motion Evaluation Metrics**, we identify five dimensions based on human perception in motion video assessment and develop fine-grained evaluation metrics, providing deeper insights into models' strengths and weaknesses in motion quality. (2) **Meta-Guided Motion Prompt Generation**, a structured method that extracts meta-information, generates diverse motion prompts with LLMs, and refines them through human-AI validation, resulting in a multi-level prompt library covering six key dynamic scene dimensions. (3) **Human-Aligned Validation Mechanism**, we provide human preference annotations to validate our benchmarks, with our metrics achieving an average 35.3\% improvement in Spearmanâ€™s correlation over baseline methods. This is the first time that the quality of motion in videos has been evaluated from the perspective of human perception alignment. Additionally, we will soon release VMBench as an open-source benchmark, setting a new standard for evaluating and advancing motion generation models.
